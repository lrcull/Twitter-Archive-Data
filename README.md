# Twitter-Archive-Data

The requirements of of this project were to gather data from the We Rate Dogs Twitter account,
clean, and analyze using Python and Jupyter Notebook. 

There were two files (We Rate Dogs Twitter archive and image prediction file) that needed to be loaded correctly into a Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, data from We Rate Dogs Twitter archive needed to be gleaned using Twitter's API. 

Once the data were gathered, it needed to be assessed and cleaned. The requirements of the project were to document 8 quality issues and 2 tidiness issues, clean the dataset, and use visualizations and analysis to communicate insights about the data.
